Dark winter, necrotic
Seems this will never end
TransgressionsMy burdens are forever

Denial, holding on
It′s grip, it chokes the life
Of what was and will be
The eternal present

Who of you will dare to sit in the throne?
Who of you will dare?

You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it's starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles

Declension, this poison
The power killing me
Detachment, who am I?
What have I done?

The violence, full of hate
The habit of our sins
Atonement buried in an unmarked grave

Who of you will dare to sit in the throne?
Who of you will dare?

You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it′s starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles

Is it all you hoped for
Is it all that you dreamed?
Is it all you hoped for?
Feel the weight being king

Is it all you hoped for?
Feel the weight being king

Who of you will dare to sit in the throne?
Who of you will dare?

You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it's starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles

You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it's starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles
